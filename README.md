# Shen-Bot
A Personal Project on AI Agents to learn and gain experience in building AI frameworks and a personal goal of learning to read financial statements.

## Context
As a personal goal to learn to read company financial statements, this will serve as an Agentic System that consists of how a financial firm would normally operate when analysing an invested company's financial statements (based on my own naive interpretation of how financial institutions work), and form an opinion on whether it should be invested in further. Given that I too want to learn exactly how each role operates and the insights/understanding of how to evaluate the financial statements, the system should be verbose in explaining its ideology when evaluating the statement, as well as highlighting the key considerations or metrics used when evaluating. 

## Input Requirements
- Company's name 

## Output Requirements
- A summary on the company's financials
- A log of the key considerations/metrics that were used to evalaute, as well as how they were used
- An overall opinion on whether the company should be vested in (% metric preferred)
- If so, how much based on different risk profiles of the investor
